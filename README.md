# odin-landing-page
This project is part of the 'Foundations' curriculum by The Odin Project and appears at the end of the 'Flexbox' section. 
The assignment gave the freedom to make the landing page like we want to and being a huge Max Verstappen fan, I just sort of made a fan page for him and the team.
Flexbox has been heavily used in making this landing page.
